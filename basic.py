# # Creating variable

# # string

# #Sentence string
# label = "Hello " + name
# print(label)

# first_name = str(input("input is your first name: "))

# # Using type : to know the data type used
# print(type(name))

# # int 
# age = 21
# # age = age + 1

# # Using multiple assignment
# # Assigning strings to it value or to each other if they are equivalent
# name, age, number = "Tolux", 21, 2349038358375

# Built in functions/method
# Few Useful method for strings

# # Type casting: converting the data type of an element to another data type  
# number = 12
# control = "The crowd"

# number = str(number)
# print(control + number)

# # Using input
# person_name = input("Input your name: ")
# persons_age = int(input("How old are you?: "))

# persons_age += 1

# print(f'Hello {person_name}, you would be {persons_age} next year. You must be excited! Adulthood na scam')

# Using math function through import
# import math

# pi = 3.14
# print(math.ceil(pi))

# from math import ceil
